## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [x] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Remembering tip settings across app restarts (if <10mins)
- [x] Being able to divide the amount by a specified number of people
- [x] Combine divided portions of the bill
